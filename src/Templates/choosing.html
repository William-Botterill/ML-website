In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship
 between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled
<br>
 as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship
  between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x).
<br>
  Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical
   estimation problem it is linear
<br>
 , in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is
   linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data.
<br>
  For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.</p>
