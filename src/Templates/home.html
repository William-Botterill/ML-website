  <p>We made Learn ML to make it easier to digest the beginnersâ€™ aspects of
    Machine Learning by introducing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A simple Working model for you to tinker with</li>
    <li>Clear documentation to work through</li>
    <li>Quiz content to build your recall knowledge</li>
    <li>Further reading to advance your understanding</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Take your time to get used to each stage of the learning program and take
    in the concepts so that your knowledge is preserved for the area of machine
     learning you would like to specialise. The best way to progress is
     confidently!</p>
  <h2>Uses of machine learning</h2>
  <p>As computers have evolved to be smarter than ever before, being able to
    beat Chess Grand Masters and simulate vehicle landings on Mars, one of the
    most exciting new opportunities has been using machine learning to predict
    and understand data in all forms such as images, voices to numbers in a
    table! </p>
  <p>Due to a huge delay in the transfer of signals between Mars and Earth AI
    had to be used on Perseverance to allow for it to land safely.
